Survey Kitten
=============
Survery Kitten is Jaime, Michael, Jonathon, Christoph.

Description
-----------
Survey Kitten was originally Survey Gorilla but that got changed because most of us like cats.  If it's part of the internet, it has to be cat friendly.
	
Built over a three day period, SK was a collaborative effort between the four of us to create a full featured CRUD application with some nice extras to show how awesome we all are at writing great code.  We used an agile process, starting with user stories, moving from there to wireframes and specs, then a detailed plan for an MVP as well as options if time permitted.  We then assigned each team member a portion of the project and created what you see here.

As the name suggests, SK is a survey application.  User can create accounts, create and take surveys and get feedback and details on surveys that they have created.  Over the course of the development cycle we implemented core features and had to make numerous design decisions.  For example, there was initially some question as to whether or not non logged in users should be able to take surveys.  As development proceeded we collectively decided that allowing this didn't fit with the application, and so only registered users are able to participate.

The application is built in Sinatra using a skeleton created by Dev Bootcamp.  As such it is only fully supported in MacOS X.
